# UntitledGame
This is my first real attempt at game programming; as such, this is currently geared towards accomplishing simple goals such as:
-Displaying graphics
-Creating a movable character that responds fluidly to controls
-Simple interaction between player and environment (not falling through the ground or walking through walls)
-Creating other moving bodies with simple patterns/AI
-etc.

Depending on the progress in these areas, this may become the basis for a proper game.

This project will make use of the SFML multimedia libraries:
